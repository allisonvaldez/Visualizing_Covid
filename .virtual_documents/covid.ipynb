"""
This project explores Covid-19 data from ___ and will visualize it using Ployly Express in Python. It will provide 
more than a dozen of bar charts, line graphs, bubble charts, and scatter plots. Exploration of the data will help 
people to understand likely complex scenarios unfolding to make predictions for the future. It will examine the 
impacts of conducting preventative measures and other hygenic practices. It will provide some arguements on which
health resources will best manage the outbreak. In closing, this project will summerize modeling, simulation, and 
analysis.

Tools and technology used in the project: 
    - Google Colab(Runtime type - GPU)

Requirements to Build the Project: 
    - Basic knowledge of Python
    - Basic understanding of graphs and charts
    - Data visualization
    - Pandas
    - Numpy
    - Matplotlib
    - Plotly Express
    - Choropleth
    - Wordcloud

"""
We will view the data in a bar graph with Plotly Express. Visualization is done by moving the cursor within the plot. We 
view the label by navigating and hovering over an item. Using a bar graph, we can either analyze the relation between the 
columns themselves or the columns and rows. If we performed the analysis between the columns our data contains numerical
variables. Performing the analysis between columns and rows means we are dealing with categorical variables. 

We limit the analysis to the top 15 countries with the most cases, color code them, and make the data viewable when the 
cursor hovers. We will study each countries' total number of cases per country/region and continent.
