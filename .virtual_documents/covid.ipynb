"""
This project explores Covid-19 data from ___ and will visualize it using Ployly Express in Python. It will provide 
more than a dozen of bar charts, line graphs, bubble charts, and scatter plots. Exploration of the data will help 
people to understand likely complex scenarios unfolding to make predictions for the future. It will examine the 
impacts of conducting preventative measures and other hygenic practices. It will provide some arguements on which
health resources will best manage the outbreak. In closing, this project will summerize modeling, simulation, and 
analysis.

Tools and technology used in the project: 
    - Google Colab(Runtime type - GPU)

Requirements to Build the Project: 
    - Basic knowledge of Python
    - Basic understanding of graphs and charts
    - Data visualization
    - Pandas
    - Numpy
    - Matplotlib
    - Plotly Express
    - Choropleth
    - Wordcloud

import pandas as pd

# Import libraries for data visualization
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Importing Plotly's offline verision

# STEP 2: IMPORT DATASETS FOR ANALYSIS

"""
The following data is contained in the files:
1. covid.csv - contains Country/Region, Continent,  Population, TotalCases, NewCases, TotalDeaths, NewDeaths, 
                TotalRecovered, NewRecovered, ActiveCases, Serious, Critical, Tot Cases/1M pop, Deaths/1M pop,
                TotalTests, Tests/1M pop, WHO Region, iso_alpha.
2. covid_grouped - contains Date(from 20-01-22 to 20-07-27), Country/Region, Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered, Active, 
                New cases, New deaths, New recovered, WHO Region, iso_alpha.
3. coviddeath - contains real-world examples of a number of Covid-19 deaths and the reasons behind the deaths.

"""
We will visualize the bar graph via Plotly Express. Visualization is done by moving the cursor into any plot. We view the
label by navigating with the cursor. We can view and analyze the data using the relation between the columns. We will limit
the view to the top 15 countries, color code them, and make the data viewable when the cursor hovers.
