# Visualizing COVID

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro/Objective

This project explores COVID-19 data from the World Health Organization (WHO), and visualizes it using Plotly Express in Python. We explore the data in more than a dozen bar charts, line graphs, bubble charts, scatter plots, word clouds, and natural earth projections. This was a personal endevour as I was interested in what the COVID data was as in its various forms--hoping this would depart knowledge for further analysis for research. I saught to provide insight, although it is 20/20 vision in hindsight, how COVID impacted countless people as it moved throughout the world. The data examines and compares amongst countries: case numbers, the causes of death, case fatality rate, recovery rates, testing rates, and death rates. In closing, it sharpened my skillset to summerize modeling, provide simulations, and thorough analysis.
